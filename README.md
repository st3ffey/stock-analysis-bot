# stock-analysis-bot

This project combines a couple of different skills. The script provides tools for fetching and analyzing stock data via yfinance and the Bing Search API (for news). It can retrieve stock prices, recent news, financial statements, and stock tickers. The script also integrates with OpenAI to offer insights or analysis on stocks. 

Ultimately, I prompt the llm to output analysis in the form of pros and cons, and deploy to a local webapp via Flask.
